\prefacesection{Abstract}

\emph{\hspace*{0.7in}Due to huge usage of internet, online data exchange is exponentially increased. Many promising technologies are used to handle the data storage needs in past decades but none of them to be proven sufficient. As a result every industry facing the problem data storagecomes up with in-house solution, and these lead to foundation of standard of NoSQL means not actually SQL (Structured Query Language). So oracle also came up with its product i.e. Oracle NoSQL, which is in developing phase.This project will deal with a Graphical User Interface and Web Services to the Oracle NoSQL Database which will simplify the utility of the Oracle NoSQL.Experimental results show that the proposed solution will be useful for the naive users to use Oracle NoSQL effectively. }
